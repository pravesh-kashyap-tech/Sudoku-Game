Difficulty Selection – Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard puzzles.

Command-Based Gameplay – Play by entering commands:

1 R C N → Place number N at row R, column C

2 R C → Erase number at row R, column C

3 → Get a hint (fills one safe move)

4 → Check board for rule violations (for checking the generated grid is valid or not) 

5 → Solve puzzle and display the full solution

6 → Quit the game

Input Validation – Ensures each move follows Sudoku rules.

🚀 How It Works

The player selects a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).

The game generates a Sudoku puzzle with some cells blank.

The player interacts using commands to place or remove numbers, request hints, or check the board.

Players can either solve the puzzle themselves or use the built-in solver.

When completed correctly, a victory message is displayed.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (no external libraries required, runs in the terminal).

📌 Future Enhancements

Timer mode ⏳ with countdown and “Game Over” on timeout.

Score system 🏆 to reward hint-free solves.

Save & Load feature for continuing puzzles later.
